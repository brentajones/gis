      <abstract>Accident - (1975-current): This data file contains information about crash characteristics and environmental conditions at the time of the crash. There is one record per crash. FARS data are made available to the public in Statistical Analysis System (SAS) data files as well as Database Files (DBF). Over the years changes have been made to the type of data collected and the way the data are presented in the SAS data files. Some data elements have been dropped and new ones added, coding of individual data elements has changed, and new SAS data files have been created. Coding changes and the years for which individual data items are available are shown in the “Data Element Definitions and Codes” section of this document. The FARS Coding and Editing Manual contains a detailed description of each SAS data elements including coding instructions and attribute definitions. The Coding Manual is published for each year of data collection. Years 2001 to current are available at: http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Cats/listpublications.aspx?Id=J&amp;ShowBy=DocType Note: In this manual the word vehicle means in-transport motor vehicle unless otherwise noted.</abstract>
      <purpose>One of the primary objectives of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is to reduce the staggering human toll and property damage that motor vehicle traffic crashes impose on our society.

FARS is a census of fatal motor vehicle crashes with a set of data files documenting all qualifying fatalities that occurred within the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico since 1975. To qualify as a FARS case, the crash had to involve a motor vehicle traveling on a trafficway customarily open to the public, and must have resulted in the death of a motorist or a non-motorist within 30 days of the crash.</purpose>

        <attrdef>This data element records the number of drunk drivers involved in the fatal crash and is derived from data elements in the Vehicle and Person data files.

Data from the Vehicle and Person data files are analyzed and if there is sufficient information to conclude that a driver was drunk, i.e., if the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is positive, or if the police reported alcohol involvement, then the driver is counted as a drunk driver. A driver being charged with an alcohol violation by itself does not have the driver counted as a drunk driver. Note that alcohol data is often missing. For that reason this data element may undercount the actual number of drunk drivers. For detailed analysis of alcohol involvement, the alcohol data files should be used.
